- Hi, I'm Daniel Kunk (@dankunk).

- I'm interested in biotechnology, molecular biology, agricultural biology, and entomology!

- Currently, I'm working on projects involving the analysis of biological data using R, Python, Bash, and I am also beginning to explore Julia and C/C++.

- I've recently created an R package, EPGplotR, designed for plotting Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) recordings of aphids. Check it out here: https://github.com/dankunk/EPGplotR

- You can also follow my GitHub page for updates on my latest projects: https://github.com/dankunk.

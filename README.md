- 👋 Hi, I’m @dankunk! also known as Daniel Kunk.
- 👀 I’m interested in biotechnology, molecular biology, agriculture, and insects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects for the analysis of biological data in R, python, and bash!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automated code for data analysis on plant-aphid data, anywhere from behavioral assays to bioinformatics workflows. 
- 📫 How to reach me is via email... Daniel.kunk@colostate.edu.
- I just made an R package for plotting EPG (electrical penetration graph) recordings of aphids! Check it out at https://github.com/dankunk/EPGplotR!
